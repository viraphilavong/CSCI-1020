			<h2>Target Audience</h2>
				<p>
				Here's a breakdown of game category by demographic:
				<p>
				Men 20-35: Shooter, Racing, Action RPG, Card Battle, Strategy
				<p>
				Male 35-50: Casino/Poker
				<p>
				Women 20-35: Brain/Quiz, Mgmt/Sim
				<p>
				Women 35-50: Slots, Solitaire, Social Turn-Based
				<p>
				While males tend to prefer competitive, player vs. player games, females, according to the study, tend to gravitate towards games that are less competitive and tend to be played in a more enduring way.  For example, Management/Simulation games are very popular among younger females, where players build up and develop an environment over time, as well as Brain/Quiz games that can be played over time with friends.  For example, Bike Race Manic is an endless, fast-paced motorbike game that is currently listed on Apptopia.  According to Flurry, Bike Race Manic would appeal to male and female users aged 20-25.

		<h2>How It All Started</h2>
				<p>
				The history of video games goes as far back as the early 1950s, when academics began designing simple games, simulations, and artificial intelligence programs as part of their computer science research[citation needed]. Video gaming would not reach mainstream popularity until the 1970s and 1980s, when arcade video games, gaming consoles and home computer games were introduced to the general public. Since then, video gaming has become a popular form of entertainment and a part of modern culture in most parts of the world.
