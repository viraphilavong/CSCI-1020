	<h1>In the Future</h1>
		<h2>OCULUS RIFT</h2>

		<h3>A little blurb</h3>
			<article>
			The Rift is a virtual reality head-mounted display developed by Oculus VR. During its period as an independent company, Oculus VR raised US$2.4 million for the development of the Rift.[3]
			The consumer version of the product will be released in Q1 2016. Based on the Crescent Bay prototype, it features an improved tracking system that accommodates seated and standing experiences, according to Oculus VR, along with updated ergonomics and a tweaked industrial design.[1] Oculus released two 'development kits', DK1 in late 2012 and DK2 in mid 2014, to give developers a chance to develop content in time for the Rift's release; these have also been purchased by many virtual reality enthusiasts for general usage. Oculus has stated that there will not be a DK3 but will instead release the consumer version next.[6]

		<h3>History</h3>
			<article>
			Through Meant to be Seen (MTBS)'s 3D discussion forums,[7] Palmer Luckey, the founder of Oculus, developed the idea of creating a new head-mounted display that was both more effective than what was then on the market, and inexpensive for gamers.

			Coincidentally, John Carmack had been doing his own research and happened upon Luckey's developments. After sampling an early unit, Carmack favored Luckey's prototype and just before the 2012 Electronic Entertainment Expo, Id Software announced that their future updated version of Doom 3, which would be known as BFG Edition, would be compatible with head-mounted display units.[8] During the convention, Carmack introduced a duct taped head-mounted display based on Luckey's Oculus Rift prototype, which ran Carmack's own software. The unit featured a high speed IMU and a 5.6-inch (14 cm) LCD display, visible via dual lenses, that were positioned over the eyes to provide a 90 degrees horizontal and 110 degrees vertical stereoscopic 3D perspective.[9][10]

			On March 25, 2014, Facebook announced that it had agreed to buy Oculus VR for $400 million in cash, $1.6 billion in Facebook stock, and an additional $300 million subject to Oculus VR meeting certain financial targets in a transaction expected to close in the second quarter of 2014.[11][12][13]
